In this article, we will explore the life and career of Olvido Hormigos, the Spanish politician who became a celebrity after her sex video went viral. We will also analyze the social and legal implications of her case, and how it reflects the changes and challenges that women face in the digital age.
  
Olvido Hormigos was born in 1971 in Los YÃ©benes, a small town in the province of Toledo. She studied teaching and worked as a primary school teacher for 20 years. She was married and had three children. She joined the Socialist Party in 2007 and became a councilwoman in 2011. She was in charge of culture, sports and youth affairs in the town hall.
 
In August 2012, Hormigos sent a video of herself masturbating to her lover, a football coach who was 10 years younger than her. She had met him through a mutual friend and had started an affair with him. She later claimed that she made the video because she was bored and lonely, and that she wanted to spice up her relationship. She also said that she trusted him and that he had promised to delete the video after watching it.
 
However, the video somehow ended up in the hands of her ex-husband, who had separated from her a few months earlier. He allegedly showed it to some of her colleagues from the Socialist Party, who decided to spread it online as a way of discrediting her and forcing her to resign. The video quickly went viral and reached millions of viewers. Hormigos became the target of insults, jokes and threats from strangers and acquaintances alike. She also received pressure from her party and her family to quit her political career.
